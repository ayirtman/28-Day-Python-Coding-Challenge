# Day 3 Python Challenge: Lists and Tuples

![Day 3](https://github.com/ayirtman/28-Day-Python-Coding-Challenge/blob/main/images/day3.jpeg)

This is the third day of the Python Challenge, focusing on working with lists and tuples in Python.

## Exercise

The goal for today is to develop a Python program that removes duplicates from a list. The specifications are as follows:
- The program should allow the user to input a list.
- The program should then output the same list, but without any duplicate elements.

## Bonus

For an extra challenge, modify your program so that it maintains the original order of the list.

## Usage

Run the python script `day3_challenge.py`:

```bash
python3 day3_challenge.py
```

## Solution
Solutions for this challenge are available in the day3_solution.py and day3_bonus_solution.py files. You can run them the same way:

```bash
python3 day3_solution.py
python3 day3_bonus_solution.py
```
