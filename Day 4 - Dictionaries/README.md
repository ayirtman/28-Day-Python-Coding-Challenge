This is the fourth day of the Python Challenge, focusing on working with dictionaries in Python.

## Exercise

The goal for today is to develop a simple phonebook application using dictionaries. The specifications are as follows:
- The program should allow the user to add, remove, and look up contacts.
- Contact details should include name and phone number.

## Bonus

For an extra challenge, extend your phonebook application to support additional contact details, such as email address.

## Usage

Run the python script `day4_challenge.py`:

```bash
python3 day4_challenge.py
```

## Solution
Solutions for this challenge are available in the `day4_solution.py` and `day4_bonus_solution.py` files. You can run them the same way:

```python
python3 day4_solution.py
python3 day4_bonus_solution.py
```

Remember, it's more beneficial to try to solve the exercise and the bonus yourself before looking at the solutions!
