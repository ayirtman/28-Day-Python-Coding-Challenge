# 28-Day Python Coding Challenge

Welcome to the 28-Day Python Coding Challenge! This repository contains my solutions to a 28-day coding challenge focused on Python programming. Each day, I explore a specific topic or concept in Python and complete a coding exercise to strengthen my skills.

The aim of this challenge is to improve my Python proficiency, explore different areas of Python development, and gain hands-on experience by solving real-world programming problems. Throughout the challenge, I'll be covering various topics, including core programming concepts, data structures, file handling, web development, data analysis, and more.

I have structured this challenge to provide a gradual progression in difficulty, starting from basic concepts and building up to more advanced topics. Each day includes a coding exercise with a specific case to solve, allowing me to apply the knowledge gained during the challenge.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this coding challenge is to sharpen my Python programming skills and enhance my understanding of various Python concepts and libraries. By committing to the 28-day challenge, I aim to:

- Strengthen my foundation in core programming concepts.
- Deepen my knowledge of Python's syntax, data structures, and control flow.
- Gain practical experience in solving programming problems and implementing algorithms.
- Explore Python libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, Pandas, Flask, and scikit-learn.
- Enhance my ability to read and understand other people's code.
- Improve my debugging and problem-solving skills.

I believe that consistent practice and focused learning are essential to become proficient in any programming language, and this coding challenge provides a structured approach to achieving that goal.

## Prerequisites

To participate in this coding challenge, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The code is compatible with Python 3. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Getting Started

To get started with this coding challenge, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/ayirtman/28-Day-Python-Coding-Challenge.git
   ```
2. Change into the cloned directory:
   ```shell
   cd 28-day-python-coding-challenge
   ```
3. Each day's solution code is provided in a separate Python file (e.g., day1.py for Day 1). You can run the code for a specific day by executing the corresponding Python file:
   ```shell
   python day1.py
   ```
4. Explore the solutions and coding exercises for each day in the challenge. Feel free to modify the code, experiment, and learn from it.
5. You can customize and expand upon this template to provide more details, instructions, and any other relevant information you want to include in your README.md file. Good luck with your coding challenge, and I hope you find this template helpful!
