# Day 2 Python Challenge: Control Flow, If-Else Statements, Loops

![Day 2](https://github.com/ayirtman/28-Day-Python-Coding-Challenge/blob/main/images/day2.jpeg)

This is the second day of the Python Challenge, focusing on control flow in Python, including:
- If-Else statements
- For and While loops

## Exercise

The goal for today is to develop a Python program that simulates a simple guessing game. The specifications are as follows:
- The program should choose a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user should try to guess this number.
- The program should give feedback on whether the user's guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Bonus

For an extra challenge, modify your program to limit the number of guesses the user can make. If they exceed this limit without guessing the number, they lose.

## Usage

Run the python script `day2_challenge.py`:

```bash
python3 day2_challenge.py
```

## Solution
Solutions for this challenge are available in the day2_solution.py and day2_bonus_solution.py files. You can run them the same way:

```bash
python3 day2_solution.py
python3 day2_bonus_solution.py
```
